Alan's DDD Intro
================

Toy project for me to try things out and do Domain Driven Design the way I normally like to do it.

I used this in live coding demos in my talk at Christchurch Code Camp 2012.
The slides for that are on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/christensena/domain-driven-design-demonstrated "Domain Driven Design Demonstrated")
